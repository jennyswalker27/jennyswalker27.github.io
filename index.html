  <h1 style="color: darkred; font-family: Georgia;"><b><u><i>Our Story</i></u></b></h1>

  <p style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">
    Tekton construction was founded in 1934 when a father and son began building barns and small homes in their rural Indiana town. What started as a two-man crew with hand tools and hard work has grown throughout the generations into a multi-million dollar business focusing on residential and commercial building projects.
  </p>

  <p style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">
    Tekton's growth is fueled by a commitment to quality, innovation and the knowledge that buildings shape our communities. With thousands of successful projects completed, we continue to push boundaries in the industry through sustainable designs and client-focused service.
